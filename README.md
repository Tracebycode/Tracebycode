# 👨‍💻 Abhishek Barik — Backend & System Engineer

🚀 Passionate about building scalable backend systems, high-performance APIs, and reliable cloud-ready infrastructure.  
I love solving real-world problems through systems design, automation, database engineering, and backend development.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🏗️ Backend Development — RESTful APIs, microservices, authentication, async jobs
- 🗄️ Databases — PostgreSQL, Supabase, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- ☁️ Systems Engineering — CI/CD pipelines, Linux servers, Docker, cloud deployments
- 🧪 Testing & Quality — Unit testing, load testing, API validation
- 🔒 Security & Reliability — Logging, monitoring, rate-limiting, API key security

## 🧩 Highlights & What I’ve Built

- 🧠 **Smart Task Manager Backend** – Auto-classification engine, audit logging, task workflows  
- 🔁 **CI/CD Automation** – Auto deploy backend to cloud using GitHub Actions  
- 🛡️ **Secure APIs** – Token-based auth, rate-limit, schema validation  
- 📊 **Database Architecture** – Normalized schema design, performance-focused queries

## 🧱 Backend Philosophy

> Clean code ⚡ Scalable systems ⚡ API-first design ⚡ Automation everywhere ⚡ Logs never lie

I believe:
- If a system breaks at scale → it was never engineered, only written
- Documentation is part of the product
- Testing is not optional
- A backend must be invisible — but powerful
